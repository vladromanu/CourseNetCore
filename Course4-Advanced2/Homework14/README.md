# 1. Integer with the largest number of divisors.

    Write a program that uses multiple threads to find the integer in the range 1 to 100 000 that has the largest number of divisors.
    By using threads, your program will should take less time to do the computation when it is run on a multiprocessor computer.
    At the end of the program, output the elapsed time, the integer that has the largest number of divisors, and the number of divisors that it has.
