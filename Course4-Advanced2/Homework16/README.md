# 3. Fix the UI Windows App

    The app has 2 text boxes, 2 btn and 2 text areas. If enter an URL in a textbox and press ok, in the text area the result is displayed.

    App is freezing now, if you should fix that. In the implementation have a look also on exception handling.

    Provide 2 implementations
        using BackgroundWorker
        using async/await

    the app is here: https://github.com/andreiscutariu002/wantsome-dotnet-public/tree/master/advanced.day.02.threading.home/sln/UiFormApp
